Verdigris: An interpreted programming language based on Rust, implemented in Rust

features:
- structs:
    struct Name {
        field: type,
        field: type,
        ...
    }
    impl name {
        #associated fn
        fxn name(args)...

        #struct methods must take self as a first param
        fxn name(self, args)...
    }

- functions:
    fxn name(args) -> return {}

- closures:
    let closure = |args| {}

- enums:
    enum Name {
        Variant1,
        Variant2,
        Variant3,
    }

- traits
    trait Name {
        fxn name(args) -> Type {}
    }

- nil type
- error struct
    implemented as a struct or enum implementing the error trait

while and for loops, conditional statements, etc.

any code not in a function gets directly executed (like python)
